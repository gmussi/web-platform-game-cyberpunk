  - Platform tool: place platform tiles that are one-way in gameplay
  - Autotile behavior: platforms are treated as non-solid for solid-tile autotiling
  - With autotile ON, platform placement randomly picks tile index 49â€“52

## Recent Improvements

### File Structure Reorganization (Phase 1 & 2) âœ… COMPLETED

The project has been recently reorganized for better maintainability and developer experience:

- **Centralized Type System**: All TypeScript types consolidated in `src/types/` directory
- **Organized Assets**: Game assets restructured under `public/assets/` with logical subdirectories
- **Modular Architecture**: Source code reorganized into `core/`, `entities/`, `data/` directories
- **Enhanced Configuration**: Centralized game configuration and data management
- **Eliminated Duplication**: Removed duplicate files and consolidated imports

### Deployment Fixes (Latest) âœ… COMPLETED

Recent fixes to ensure proper deployment on Vercel:

- **Asset Path Correction**: Fixed all asset paths to use `/assets/` prefix for proper Vercel serving
- **Missing Assets Included**: Added audio files and map data that were previously ignored by git
- **Vercel Configuration**: Removed unnecessary `vercel.json` to allow automatic Next.js detection
- **Git Configuration**: Updated `.gitignore` to include all game assets while excluding test artifacts
- **Error Handling**: Added robust Phaser error handling for deployed environment

### Key Benefits

- âœ… Better maintainability with centralized types and configuration
- âœ… Improved developer experience with logical file organization
- âœ… Enhanced scalability with modular architecture
- âœ… Performance optimizations through reduced duplication
- âœ… **Deployment Ready**: All assets properly configured and included
- âœ… **Production Stable**: Game works correctly on Vercel deployment

## Customization

### Adding New Characters

1. Add character data to `characters` object in `src/main.ts`
2. Create character sprite assets in `img/charX/` directory with:
   - `metadata.json` file defining animations and rotations
   - `rotations/` folder with 4-directional sprites (north, south, east, west)
   - `animations/` folder with animation sequences (walk, breathing-idle, jumping-1)
3. Update character selection UI in `src/scenes/CharacterSelectScene.ts`
4. Add fallback sprite generation method in `src/generators/SpriteGenerator.ts` if needed

### Adding New Enemy Types

1. Extend the `Enemy` class in `src/Enemy.ts`
2. Add new enemy sprite generation method in `src/generators/SpriteGenerator.ts`
3. Add new enemy creation methods
4. Place enemies in `src/scenes/GameScene.ts` `createEnemies()` method

### Using the Map Editor

1. **Access**: Press 'M' key in-game or click "Map Editor" button
2. **UI Layout**: Clean interface with editing area (80% left) and control panel (20% right)
3. **Tools**: Select from Player, Portal, Enemy1, Enemy2, Solid tiles, or Erase
4. **Tile Placement**: Click to place tiles, right-click to remove
5. **Sprite Selection**: Press 'T' to open sprite picker for solid tiles
6. **Navigation**: Use arrow keys or WASD to move around the map
7. **Saving**: Click "Save Map" to download your custom map
8. **Loading**: Click "Load Map" to load a custom map file
9. **Grid**: Press 'G' or click "Grid" button to toggle grid overlay
10. **Map Resizing**: Use +/- Row/Col buttons to adjust map dimensions

### Adding New Levels

1. **Using Map Editor**: Create custom levels with the built-in editor
2. **Manual Creation**: Modify platform generation in `src/scenes/GameScene.ts` `createPlatforms()` method
3. **Map Files**: Create JSON map files following the format in `maps/default.json`
4. **Validation**: Use `MapSystem.validateMapData()` to ensure proper structure
5. **Background**: Add custom background images to `img/` directory
