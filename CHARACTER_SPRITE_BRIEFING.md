## Design Guidelines

### Pixel Art Style

- Use clean, sharp pixel edges
- Avoid anti-aliasing or smooth gradients
- Each pixel should be clearly defined
- Use limited color palette for each character
- Maintain consistent lighting (top-down)

### Composition

- Character should be centered in the 32x32 canvas
- Weapons and accessories should extend slightly beyond the main body
- Ensure character is recognizable at small size
- Maintain good contrast between elements

### Color Usage

- Use the specified hex colors as primary references
- Add subtle variations for depth (darker/lighter shades)
- Neon colors should be bright and vibrant
- Darker colors for shadows and depth

### Animation Guidelines

#### Idle Animations (3 frames per character)

- **Idle Base**: Character's default standing pose, ready for action
- **Idle Look Up**: Head tilted upward, scanning surroundings or looking for threats
- **Idle Weapon Spin**: Character showing off their weapon/skills with spinning/flourishing motions

#### Walking Animation (3 frames per character)

- **Walking Frame 1**: Left leg forward, opposite arm swinging back
- **Walking Frame 2**: Right leg forward, opposite arm swinging back
- **Walking Frame 3**: Mid-stride position, balanced and centered
- Create smooth transition between frames for fluid movement

#### Jump Animations (2 frames per character)

- **Jump Up**: Character ascending, legs bent/knees up, arms raised for balance
- **Jump Down**: Character descending, legs extended down, arms spread for landing
- Show clear difference between ascending and descending states

### Animation Consistency

- Maintain same character silhouette across all states
- Keep proportions consistent (64x64 canvas)
- Ensure weapons and accessories remain recognizable
- Color schemes should be identical across all states
- Each character should have unique movement style reflecting their personality

### Technical Considerations

- Ensure sprites work well against dark backgrounds
- Maintain readability at game resolution
- Avoid too many small details that won't be visible
- Keep design simple but distinctive

## File Naming Convention

- `cyber_warrior_idle_base.png`, `cyber_warrior_idle_lookup.png`, `cyber_warrior_idle_spin.png` (Idle animations)
- `cyber_warrior_walk1.png`, `cyber_warrior_walk2.png`, `cyber_warrior_walk3.png` (Walking frames)
- `cyber_warrior_jump_up.png`, `cyber_warrior_jump_down.png` (Jump states)

- `quantum_mage_idle_base.png`, `quantum_mage_idle_lookup.png`, `quantum_mage_idle_spin.png` (Idle animations)
- `quantum_mage_walk1.png`, `quantum_mage_walk2.png`, `quantum_mage_walk3.png` (Walking frames)
- `quantum_mage_jump_up.png`, `quantum_mage_jump_down.png` (Jump states)

- `stealth_rogue_idle_base.png`, `stealth_rogue_idle_lookup.png`, `stealth_rogue_idle_spin.png` (Idle animations)
- `stealth_rogue_walk1.png`, `stealth_rogue_walk2.png`, `stealth_rogue_walk3.png` (Walking frames)
- `stealth_rogue_jump_up.png`, `stealth_rogue_jump_down.png` (Jump states)

- `plasma_paladin_idle_base.png`, `plasma_paladin_idle_lookup.png`, `plasma_paladin_idle_spin.png` (Idle animations)
- `plasma_paladin_walk1.png`, `plasma_paladin_walk2.png`, `plasma_paladin_walk3.png` (Walking frames)
- `plasma_paladin_jump_up.png`, `plasma_paladin_jump_down.png` (Jump states)

## Additional Notes

- These sprites will be used in a Phaser.js game
- Characters should look futuristic and cyberpunk-themed
- Each character should have a unique silhouette
- Consider the game's dark cyberpunk aesthetic
- Sprites should convey the character's role/abilities at a glance

## Reference Context

The game features:

- Dark cyberpunk cityscape backgrounds
- Neon-lit platforms
- Robot enemies
- Energy effects and particles
- 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay

Please create 4 distinct, high-quality pixel art sprites that capture the essence of each character while maintaining the technical specifications outlined above.
